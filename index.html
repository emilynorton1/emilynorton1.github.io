      Hi! My name is Emily Norton. I am currently a marketing major at Boise State University with plans to graduate in Fall 2023. I first took interest in marketing when I realized that it combined creativity and analytics - two of my strengths. In high school I saw Boise State post a position opening for students on their Instagram for a Sports Marketing internship. I had no idea that sports marketing was a thing and I was so excited to see that I could combine two of my passions and make it a career. As a retired high school athlete, there is nothing like the atmosphere of sports and I wasn't quite ready to leave it just yet. Two years later I am currently finishing up my first year of that exact internship and it has been such a  cool experience. I got to experience game days on the sideline of The Blue, surrounded by the roaring crowd, and I got to experience our mens basketball team winning a Mountain West championship while I was courtside. I've gained so many skills and met so many amazing people - I can't wait to see what the future holds for me! I am planning on attending grad school to get my masters in marketing research and analytics & then start my career from there. I was originally set on a career in sports marketing, but I am now leaning more towards the analytical and data visualization aspect of it.
