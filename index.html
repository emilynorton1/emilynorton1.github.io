<h1>Starting Your Fitness Journey</h1>
</div>
<img id="id1" src="fitness.jpg" width="520px">


<p id="id2">The 2 main components you will need to focus on are </p>
<ol>
    <li>Lifting weights</li>
    <li>Nutrition</li>
</ol>

<h2 class="class1">Lifting</h2>

<p>The easiest split to start out with is Push, Pull, Legs. 
<div id="id2"> <p>That would look something like this:</p></div>
<p>Day 1: Push day (working the chest, triceps, and shoulders)</p>
<p>Day 2: Pull day (working the back and biceps)</p>
<p>Day 3: Legs (working the quads, hamstrings, and glutes)</p>
<p>Day 4: Rest</p>

<h2 class="class1">Nutrition</h2>

<p id="id2">What you eat and how much of it will arguably get you more results than the gym will.</p>
<p id="id2">Here is a website you can use to calculate your nutrition that aligns with your specific goals</p>

<h2 class="class1">Dummy Text</h2>

<div id="id3"><p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p></div>
<div id="id4"><p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p></div>
<p>"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum."</p>
<p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>

        <h1> Why You Should Stop ‘Gamifying’ Your Health and Fitness </h1>
        <h4>You don't need to chase a fake goal to be able to chase a real goal.</h4>
    </header>

    <p><b>By: Emily Norton</b></p>

    <img src="fitness.jpg" width=825px>

    <p>Whenever there’s a task you don’t want to do, there’s a guaranteed way to feel worse about it: Just add a whole layer of guilt and disappointment on top. Streaks that you’ll inevitably break, badges you don’t care about, check-in notifications that bug you when you were just trying to relax. Ahh, gamification.  </p>
    <p> Before we talk about all the reasons gamification is bullshit, let’s talk about why games work the way they do. In a roleplaying game, you earn “experience points” as a metaphor for real-life experience. You earn fake money because it’s meant to mimic the concept of real-life money. You’re given a quest because, in real life, people work hard in pursuit of goals. Games have these metrics and structures because the game is <i>trying to imitate real life.</i> </p>


    <section>
        <h3>Aim for consistency, not streaks</h3>
        <p>Streaks entertain you during good times with the explicit goal of heaping disappointment on you when you slip up. And they’re a particularly harmful type of misdirection, because people easily become more focused on the streak than on whatever reason they were doing the streak in the first place. </p>
        <p>I argue <u>here</u> that, should you ever find yourself suckered into chasing a streak, you should break your streak before the streak breaks you. No health habit needs to be done every day without fail. Even aside from the fact that rest days are good and often needed for physical and mental reasons, do you think your body can tell the difference between 9,999 steps and 10,000?</p>

        <li>Joining a recreational sports league, and getting to know the members of your softball/soccer/pickleball team while either crushing the competition or commiserating about your inability to do so.</li>
