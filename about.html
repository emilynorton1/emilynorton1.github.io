    <h1>My Marketing Experience</h1>

<p> 
Most of my marketing experience has come from my internship. I've learned how to plan out a social media calendar, how to execute in game promotions, how to engage a crowd, how to network, and how to use many different softwares that are commonly used for fan engagement such as vSoft and SuperfanU. Below is an example of a marketing plan our team of interns made for a women's basketball game. For this game, we ran everything. We controlled all the advertising efforts, picked what promotions we wanted to implement, engaged in community outreach, and executed in game promotions. Our efforts were extremely successful and we actually set a record attendance for women's basketball for the year.

For my position in my sorority I am on the back end of all of our social media efforts planning strategy and scheduling posts. Here is an example of a social media calendar that we use to stay on track.
