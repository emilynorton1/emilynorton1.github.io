    <h1>My Media Experience</h1>

    <p>During my weekly office hours for my internship, I help out with making birthday graphics, game day graphics, cutting songs for game days, labeling pictures for our photographers, among a lot of other random little things. Graphic design has been one of the most useful things I've learned in this internship! Here are a couple of examples of my work that has been posted on various Boise State Athletics Instagram accounts.</p>

    <p>I also have a lot of experience with media as VP of Marketing for my sorority (Alpha Gamma Delta). I run the Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok accounts, and have lot of knowledge on social media trends. My favorite apps to use for editing are Canva, Unfold, Mojo, and PicsArt. I like to keep our feed very colorful and trendy to represent our chapter well & help our account stand out amongst other chapters at our school.</p>
